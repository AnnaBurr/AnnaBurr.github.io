            </h2>
            <p class="container">The stars don’t rotate around the earth. The Earth is spinning around every day and the motion makes the stars appear as though they are rotating around the sky. Polaris (North Star) sits a large distance from Earth, located near Earth’s north celestial pole. As the earth moves on its axis the view of the stars appears as though they are spinning around the earth but the earths changing location makes stars appear further or closer depending on where it is in its rotation.</p>
